Criteria

- This feature allows percentages to be adjusted among the 5 listed entities.
- In order to submit, the total percentages of the 5 entities must equal to 100.
- The reset button allows for reverting the values to 0


Ideas for future work

- add media queries for mobile layout
- add manual input option for the third column's textfield
- add auto-adjusting sliders: all sliders begin at 20%.  if one slider is moved, the others adjust in order to maintain 100% total.
- an alernative to above, have one slider for all entities.  in order to assign slider to a table row, click on that table row.
- move slider logic to a reducer
